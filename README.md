## 💻 About this project

This project proposal was to develop an UI clone. It's a **challenge** provided by the [Rocketseat's Discover trail](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/discover). As an improvement I fetched the GitHub's API.

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
